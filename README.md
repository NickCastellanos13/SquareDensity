# SquareDensity
This is a project I don't remember why I did. But I am always interested in abstract problems that relate numbers and geometry. I am not sure if this is applicable to bigger problems, but I *believe* it may be useful to problems of systems where there is overlapping of states, for example, quantum physics.
